**Heyy folks** , 

I hope everyone is super excited and already prepping hard for **GSoC** , I totally get how it feels . I was in your shoes not too long ago, nervous + hyped at the same time 😅

Don't worry, I'll break down some **realistic points** (things you should **definitely do** and things you should **never do**).

## GSoC… but why?

This was literally the first question I asked myself when I started preparing.

I just wanted to , 

- Try something **outside of academics**
- Get real-life **SDLC experience** (Software Development Life Cycle)
- Understand how actual software is built and maintained in the real world

And honestly? There is **no better opportunity** than open source to experience all of that.


## Good Stuff to do while preping for GSoC

1. **Early contributions is an important factor**
 - Pick **one** organization that genuinely interests you
- Read their CONTRIBUTING.md, setup guide, and "good first issue" / "beginner" labels
- Take **one** small issue → solve it carefully → write a clean PR
- Give it your 100%. Request review politely.
- **Important:** 1 solid, well-documented PR >>>>>> 100 tiny/spammy PRs

2. **Proposal** 
- Read the organization’s idea list **very carefully**
- Choose a project that matches your skills + interests
- Structure:  
  - About Me  
  - Why this organization & project?  
  - My understanding of the problem  
  - Detailed timeline (week-by-week is best)  
  - Past contributions (link your PRs)  
  - Stretch goals / nice-to-haves  
  - How you’ll stay in touch / handle blockers

Be specific. Vague = rejected.

3.**Community Engagement**
- Get involved in the community , speak confidently , don't ask questions which you google
- Be active but **not annoying** , quality conversations > spamming


 4. **Learn Git & GitHub Like a Pro**

You’ll look very amateur if you:

- Force push to main branch
- Don’t write proper commit messages
- Create PRs from master instead of a feature branch
- Don’t respond to review comments

  So inorder to help you all , I have created a file called  contributers.md file , where you can add your name and a single line why you want to do GSoC and raise a PR for this repo and
  I will be reviewing your PR and merging it . Follow the example given in that file. Kindly Create a new branch then push it.

## Mistakes to avoid

1. **Spammy Pings**
Bombarding mentors hourly , respect their time with thoughtful, spaced follow-ups. Everyone is busy with their lives too.Ask genuine questions onlyy

2.**AI generated Proposal**
This is such a red flag , mentors can literally see that you have used AI just by glancing at it. Don't do it!! , Also try using different templates for your proposal , 
don't use someone else's proposal template.
- Don’t copy-paste ChatGPT output
- Write it yourself (your own words, your own excitement, your own plan)

3. **Plagarism**
I still remember when I was preping for GSoC ,Saw a dude copy-paste someone else's proposal, just swap names. Community chat called him out → zero chance. Be original or don't bother.

## Final Pep Talk 

GSoC is tough. Rejection rate is high. But even if you don’t get selected , 

- The contributions you made stay on your GitHub forever
- You’ll learn **way more** than most college projects ever teach

So go for it. Start small. Be consistent. Be genuine.
